# File Upload Error Fix Summary

## Problem
Users are getting "Failed to save uploaded file" error when trying to upload payment proof.

## Diagnostic Steps Taken

### 1. File System Check ✅
- Verified uploads directory exists with correct permissions (755)
- Confirmed directory is writable
- Tested file creation and deletion successfully

### 2. PHP Configuration Check ✅
- Verified file uploads are enabled
- Confirmed adequate file size limits (40MB)
- Confirmed temp directory is writable
- All PHP upload settings are correct

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to upload-payment-proof.php:
- Session information logging
- Detailed file information before move
- Directory permission checks
- Error capture with temporary error reporting

### 4. Path Resolution Fix
Changed from relative paths to absolute paths:
```php
// Before:
$upload_dir = '../uploads/payment_proofs/';

// After:
$upload_dir = realpath(__DIR__ . '/../uploads/payment_proofs/') . '/';
// Fallback to absolute path if realpath fails
```

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
Created comprehensive test tools:
- `test-file-upload-diagnostic.php` - System diagnostics
- `test-simple-upload.php` - Basic upload test without database
- `test-simple-upload.html` - Simple test interface
- `test-upload-enhanced.html` - Full test with debug logging
- `test-login-simulation.php` - Session simulation for testing

## Root Cause Analysis
The most likely causes were:
1. **Path resolution issues** - Relative paths not resolving correctly
2. **Session authentication** - User not properly authenticated
3. **File upload validation** - Temporary file not being recognized as uploaded

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Path Resolution
- Use absolute paths instead of relative paths
- Added fallback path resolution
- Added path validation logging

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Temporary error reporting during file move
- Detailed logging of all file operations
- Better error messages with context

### 3. Session Validation
- Added session logging for debugging
- Created test login simulation

### 4. File Validation
- Added checks for file existence and upload status
- Validate target directory permissions before move

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Upload Test**:
   - Open `test-simple-upload.html`
   - Upload a small image file
   - Check if basic file upload works

2. **Full Upload Test**:
   - Open `test-upload-enhanced.html`
   - Upload a payment proof
   - Check debug logs for detailed information

3. **Debug Log Location**:
   - `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/Agency/uploads/payment_proofs/upload_debug.log`

## Status
✅ **ENHANCED** - Added comprehensive debugging and fixed path issues.

The upload system now has:
- Absolute path resolution
- Detailed error logging
- Better error handling
- Comprehensive testing tools

If the issue persists, the debug logs will now provide detailed information about exactly where the failure occurs.
