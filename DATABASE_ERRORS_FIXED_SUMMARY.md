# Database Errors Fixed - Final Summary

## Issue: `SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'crypto_payments' doesn't exist`

### **Root Cause:**
The crypto payment system was trying to access the `crypto_payments` table and related tables that hadn't been created in the database yet.

### **Solution:**
1. **Executed SQL scripts** to create missing tables:
   - `database/crypto_payments.sql` - Created crypto_payments table
   - `database/chat_permissions.sql` - Created chat_permissions and notifications tables

### **Tables Created:**

#### 1. `crypto_payments` table:
- `id` - Primary key
- `booking_id` - Foreign key to service_bookings
- `payment_method` - ENUM('btc', 'usdt')
- `amount` - Payment amount
- `payment_address` - Crypto wallet address
- `transaction_hash` - Transaction ID (optional)
- `proof_image` - Uploaded proof image path
- `status` - Payment verification status
- `admin_notes` - Admin verification notes
- `verified_by` - Admin who verified (foreign key)
- `verified_at` - Verification timestamp
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

#### 2. `chat_permissions` table:
- Controls chat access based on payment status
- Links booking_id, user_id, and agent_id
- `can_chat` boolean flag

#### 3. `notifications` table:
- System notifications for payment updates
- Supports both user and admin notifications

#### 4. `service_bookings` enhancement:
- Added `payment_status` column with ENUM values

### **Database Schema Verification:**
âœ… All foreign key relationships established  
âœ… Proper indexes created for performance  
âœ… Enum values correctly defined  
âœ… Default values set appropriately  

### **Complete Payment Flow Now Working:**

1. **Service Booking** â†’ `service_bookings` table
2. **Payment Initiation** â†’ `crypto_payments` table (pending)
3. **User Upload Proof** â†’ Update `proof_image` field
4. **Admin Verification** â†’ Update status to 'confirmed'
5. **Chat Access** â†’ `chat_permissions` granted
6. **Notifications** â†’ `notifications` table updated

### **Files Verified Working:**
- âœ… `payment/crypto-payment.php`
- âœ… `payment/upload-payment-proof.php`
- âœ… `admin/payment-verification.php`
- âœ… `user/my-bookings.php`
- âœ… `user/chat.php`

### **Testing Results:**
- âœ… Database connections successful
- âœ… Table creation successful
- âœ… Foreign key constraints working
- âœ… Data insertion/updates working
- âœ… No more "table not found" errors

## All Database Errors Now Resolved:

### Previously Fixed:
1. âœ… **Unknown column 's.assigned_agent_id'** - Removed non-existent column references
2. âœ… **Unknown column 's.base_price'** - Fixed table/column mismatches
3. âœ… **Undefined index: 'price_range'** - Fixed user booking system to use correct table

### Newly Fixed:
4. âœ… **Table 'crypto_payments' doesn't exist** - Created missing crypto payment tables

The entire ConnectPro Agency platform is now fully functional with:
- Working booking systems (both main and user versions)
- Complete cryptocurrency payment processing
- Agent selection and assignment
- Chat access control based on payment status
- Admin verification and management
- Proper database schema with all required tables
