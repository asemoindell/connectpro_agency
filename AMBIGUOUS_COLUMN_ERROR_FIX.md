# SQLSTATE[23000] Ambiguous Column Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Fixed the following SQL error in `/admin/payments.php`:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1052 Column 'payment_status' in field list is ambiguous
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because both the `payments` table and `service_bookings` table contain a column named `payment_status`. When joining these tables in SQL queries, the database engine couldn't determine which table's `payment_status` column to use when the column was referenced without a table alias.

## Table Structure Analysis
- **payments table**: Contains `payment_status` (enum: pending, processing, completed, failed, refunded)
- **service_bookings table**: Contains `payment_status` (enum: pending, processing, confirmed, failed, cancelled)

## Fixed SQL Queries

### 1. Payment Statistics Query
**Before (line 99-108):**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_payments,
    SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'completed' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'pending' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as pending_amount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_payments,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_payments,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed_payments
FROM payments p
JOIN service_bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id
```

**After (Fixed):**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_payments,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.payment_status = 'completed' THEN p.amount ELSE 0 END) as total_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.payment_status = 'pending' THEN p.amount ELSE 0 END) as pending_amount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.payment_status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_payments,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.payment_status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_payments,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.payment_status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed_payments
FROM payments p
JOIN service_bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id
```

### 2. Payment Methods Query
**Before (line 117-126):**
```sql
SELECT 
    payment_method,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM payments p
JOIN service_bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
```

**After (Fixed):**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.payment_method,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(p.amount) as total_amount
FROM payments p
JOIN service_bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id
GROUP BY p.payment_method
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
```

## Changes Made
1. **File**: `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/Agency/admin/payments.php`
   - Added table alias `p.` prefix to all `payment_status` references in the statistics query
   - Added table alias `p.` prefix to all `amount` references in the statistics query
   - Added table alias `p.` prefix to `payment_method` reference in the methods query
   - Added table alias `p.` prefix to `amount` reference in the methods query

## Testing Results
- ✅ All SQL queries now execute without errors
- ✅ Payment statistics are calculated correctly
- ✅ Payment method breakdown works properly
- ✅ No syntax errors in the PHP file
- ✅ Database queries return expected results

## Impact
- **Fixed**: The critical SQL ambiguous column error that was preventing the payments admin page from loading
- **Improved**: Query clarity and maintainability by using explicit table aliases
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality continues to work as expected

## Files Modified
