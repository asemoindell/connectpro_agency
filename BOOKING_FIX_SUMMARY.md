# ðŸŽ‰ BOOKING SYSTEM ERROR - FIXED! 

## Summary of Fixed Issues

### âœ… Primary Error Resolved
**Error**: `Fatal error: Call to a member function execute() on null` in `book-service.php` line 50
**Cause**: Missing prepared statement definition for booking insertion
**Fix**: Added proper INSERT statement preparation before execution

### âœ… Secondary Issues Fixed
1. **Pricing Logic Error**: Removed duplicate `$total_amount` assignment that overwrote proper calculation
2. **Email Notification Error**: Fixed column reference from `s.name` to `s.title` and table from `services` to `services_enhanced`

## What Was Added/Modified

### 1. book-service.php - Fixed booking insertion
```php
// Added missing prepared statement
$stmt = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO service_bookings 
    (booking_reference, service_id, client_name, client_email, client_phone, 
     service_details, urgency_level, approval_deadline, quoted_price, 
     agent_fee, total_amount, user_id) 
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
```

### 2. Fixed pricing calculation logic
- Removed line that overwrote proper total calculation
- Now correctly calculates: Base Price + Agent Fee + Processing Fee + VAT + Tax

### 3. includes/EmailNotification.php - Fixed query
```php
// Fixed table and column references
SELECT b.*, s.title as service_name, s.description as service_description 
FROM service_bookings b 
JOIN services_enhanced s ON b.service_id = s.id 
```
