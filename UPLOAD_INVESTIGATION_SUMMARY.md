# Upload Issue Investigation Summary

## Problem
The payment proof upload feature is still not working despite multiple fixes.

## Investigation Tools Created

### 1. **Troubleshooting Tools**
- `troubleshoot-upload.html` - Comprehensive diagnostic interface
- `troubleshoot-upload.php` - Detailed environment and upload testing
- `test-minimal-upload.html` - Simple upload test with minimal code
- `test-minimal-upload.php` - Basic upload handler without complex logic

### 2. **Debug Scripts**
- `test-upload-debug.html` - Form that posts to debug script
- `test-upload-debug.php` - Shows all POST/FILES data with full error reporting
- `test-file-formats.php` - Validates file format support

## Next Steps to Identify the Issue

### Step 1: Basic Environment Check
1. Open `troubleshoot-upload.html` in your browser
2. Click "Run Basic Test"
3. Check if all environment settings are correct

### Step 2: File Upload Test
1. In the same page, click "Test with File"
2. Select a small test file (any format)
3. Click "Run File Test"
4. Check the detailed output for any errors

### Step 3: Minimal Upload Test
1. Open `test-minimal-upload.html`
2. Select a test file and upload
3. This uses the simplest possible upload code

### Step 4: Check Real Upload Script
1. Open `test-upload-debug.html`
2. Try uploading a file to see raw server response
3. Check browser developer tools for any JavaScript errors

## Common Issues to Look For

### 1. **File Upload Errors**
- `UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE` - File too large for PHP settings
- `UPLOAD_ERR_FORM_SIZE` - File too large for form setting
- `UPLOAD_ERR_PARTIAL` - File partially uploaded
- `UPLOAD_ERR_NO_TMP_DIR` - Missing temp directory
- `UPLOAD_ERR_CANT_WRITE` - Permission issues

- Directory not writable
- Permission conflicts

### 3. **PHP Configuration**
- `file_uploads = Off`
- `upload_max_filesize` too small
- `post_max_size` too small
- `memory_limit` too low

### 4. **Session Issues**
- User not logged in
- Session not started
- Session data missing

### 5. **Path Issues**
- Incorrect relative/absolute paths
- Path resolution problems

3. **If that works:** `test-upload-enhanced.html` - Test with payment system
4. **Finally:** Use the actual crypto payment page

## What to Report

Please run the troubleshooting tools and let me know:
1. What error messages you see
2. What the troubleshooting script outputs
